# Maze
For assignment 12-1, I created a maze where you need to find a key to open a lock to get the treasure. For this application, I used Blender to create the key, lock, and coin. I also used an application called Quixel Mixer. I added a small onboarding section that gives directions on how to teleport and how to grab objects. The onboarding ends with a visual description of the goal.
For the overall assets, I used the Snaps Office pack. However, I updated the materials to include some albedo, metallic and normal maps.
With the scale of the maze, I needed some key landmarks, so I added floating spheres above you that you can use to help tell where you are. I also added an arrow on your left hand to point at the next step. So it starts by pointing to the key, and once you have the key, it points to the lock and win state.
For this assignment, I used URP. I wish I had had more time to add audio and sound effects. Perhaps in a later update.
